          <p>
            I'm Serdar Salim, the founder of Simplify Budget. I spent 9 years at Twitter as a Program Manager,
            where I led global customer support agent training globally. During this time, I was also managing my own finances
            and struggling with the same budgeting problems everyone faces.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cash payments, multiple bank accounts, irregular income, and manual transactions made it impossible to get a clear picture of my finances.
            I tried many budgeting apps and even spreadsheets, but they were either too simplistic or overly complex with automation that frequently broke.
          </p>

          <p>
            I needed something that captured my real spending patterns without hours of data entry.
            Something that worked whether I was paying cash at a coffee shop or setting up automatic bill payments. So I built my own.
          </p>

          <p>
            This system has carried me through salary changes, major purchases, building an emergency fund, and planning for long-term goals.
            It's the reason I can make confident financial decisions without constantly worrying about where my money is going.

            Financial security. I sleep better at night knowing I have my spending and finances in control.
            I know how much money I need per month, my spending is more intentional, and I make informed decisions rather than going by gut feeling.
