    date: "20 Sep 25",

    content: `Here are 5 rules that will help you avoid being trapped in corporate dependency:
1. **Build Your Safety Net First** - Save 6-12 months of expenses. This isn't just emergency money—it's your freedom fund. When you have this cushion, you can take risks, say no to bad opportunities, and negotiate from a position of strength.
2. **Create Multiple Income Streams** - Don't put all your financial eggs in one corporate basket. Side projects, investments, freelance work, or even a small business. When one stream dries up, you have others flowing.
3. **Live Below Your Corporate Means** - Don't upgrade your lifestyle every time you get a raise. The more expensive your life becomes, the more trapped you are. Keep your core expenses low and bank the difference.
4. **Invest in Skills, Not Just Salary** - Learn skills that transfer across industries or make you self-sufficient. The best investment is in your ability to create value independently of any single employer.
5. **Plan Your Exit Before You Need It** - Always be building toward something beyond your current job. Whether that's a business, investments, or simply financial independence. The goal isn't to hate work—it's to work because you choose to, not because you have to.

The key is starting before you feel trapped. When you need these rules most, it's often too late to implement them effectively.`

    content: `Here are 4 steps that will help you avoid all the rookie investing mistakes:
1. **Build an emergency fund first** - 6 months of living expenses in cash. If the market tanks, you don't want to sell investments just to buy ramen.
2. **Start small & boring** - Put a portion of your income into a low-cost index fund every month. And continue learning diversification from there.
3. **Don't touch your safety net** - Your emergency fund is not your casino chips. Only touch it if the market crashes 60% which is basically once every generation, if you're lucky (or unlucky).
4. **Level up slowly** - Learn about picking stocks and platforms on your own. When you mess up (and you will), don't blame anyone and learn from your mistakes.

And yes, you'll still lose money sometimes, because your emotions will betray you. But if you stick with it, the mistakes get smaller and the wins add up.

What's the smartest or dumbest investing move you've made?`

    content: `Most people want to save money instead of spending their entire salary, and start investing. When it comes to managing their money, they simply don't have a solid plan. Creating wealth does not happen by chance, and if you don't want to leave things to luck, you need to have a solid plan.

Here's my 7-step financial management system that has been working incredibly well:
1. **Create a system that automatically logs recurring bills and income each month** - No more forgetting about subscriptions or bills. Everything is pre-loaded so I know my commitments upfront.
2. **Use a simple dashboard that shows committed vs. available money** - I can see immediately how much money I've committed to pay for the month and how much I have left for discretionary spending.
3. **Set saving and spending goals for each category** - This gives me targets to work toward rather than just tracking what I've already spent.
4. **Log each expense as it happens throughout the month** - Real-time tracking keeps me aware of my spending patterns and helps me stay on track.
5. **Track net worth monthly by entering all assets and debts** - This includes liquid savings, investments, physical assets, and all debts. It shows me if I'm actually building wealth, not just managing cash flow.
6. **Review spending monthly and adjust goals for the next month** - I look at what worked, what didn't, and make realistic adjustments for the following month.
7. **Keep historical data of expenses and net worth over time** - This long-term view shows me how my financial journey evolves and helps me spot trends.

These 7 steps allow me to live debt-free and consistently increase my wealth.`

    date: "5 Sep 25",
    views: "2.8k",

    content: `This is how I do my expenses every month using this calendar view and it helps me see my spending behavior and stick to my budget better. It also shows me instantly see which days and categories I spend the most in a given month.

I can switch to a yearly view to see all my expense totals for each month and my saving rate.

Before this I used a Google Sheets but since I can't add multiple expenses on the same day for the same category I created my own app on Google Apps Script that allows me to just that.

Anyone else track expenses this way or do something similar?

**Why the calendar view works:**
- Visual spending patterns are obvious
- You can see expensive days vs. light spending days
- Monthly totals are automatically calculated
- Easy to spot categories where you overspend
- Historical data helps with future planning

This approach transformed how I think about daily spending decisions.`

    content: `I could never find a budget app that shows all my fixed expenses at the start of the month, with due dates, and already marked as "spent" in my budget. Without that, I never really knew how much money I had left for day-to-day expenses.

So I built my own system. I've been using it for 3 years now and the difference is massive: zero debt, I hit my spending goals most months, and budgeting doesn't stress me out anymore.

**Here's how it works:**

**All fixed expenses are pre-loaded** at the beginning of each month with their due dates. Rent, insurance, subscriptions, utilities - everything is already "spent" in my budget before the month starts.

**I immediately see my available spending money** for groceries, entertainment, and variable expenses. No more guessing if I can afford something.

**Due dates prevent late fees** because everything is visible in one place. No more "oh crap, I forgot about Netflix" moments.

**Budget adjustments happen before spending** not after you've already blown through your money.

The key insight: treat fixed expenses like they've already happened, because they basically have. Then manage what's actually variable.`

    date: "1 Aug 25",

    content: `Most budget apps are built by people who don't actually budget. They're either too complicated (tracking every penny) or too simple (just showing where money went after you've spent it).

Here's what I learned after trying everything and building my own solution:

**Stop micro-managing every transaction.** Track daily totals by category instead. "I spent $47 on food today" vs logging each coffee, lunch item, etc. Same insight, 90% less work.

**Pre-commit your fixed expenses.** Most budget apps treat everything as variable. But rent isn't variable. Subscriptions aren't variable. Load these first, then manage what's actually flexible.

**Use a calendar view for expenses.** Traditional budget apps show lists or categories. But spending happens on specific days. A calendar immediately shows patterns - like how you always overspend on weekends.

**Track net worth, not just cash flow.** Most people budget to control spending but never track if they're actually building wealth. You can have perfect spending habits and still be broke if you're not monitoring assets vs. debts.

**Keep it multi-year.** Don't start fresh each month/year. Your financial life is continuous. You need to see trends over time, not just this month's snapshot.

The hardest part isn't learning the system - it's unlearning the overcomplicated habits from other apps.`

    content: `Most people don't track their budget or net worth, which is mind-boggling considering it's not even taught in school. When they finally take budgeting into their own hands, they often burn out because they're using the wrong approach.

**Common Budgeting Fallacies:**

**Too Much Automation:** Apps that auto-categorize every transaction end up inaccurate. Plus, you don't consciously engage with your spending. There needs to be a balance—I log irregular expenses manually but keep recurring expenses on autopilot.

**Too Much Clutter:** Logging every transaction to two decimals is overkill. I skip decimals for income and expenses and round my net worth to the nearest 50. Keeps things clear and quick.

**Logging Each Month Separately:** Having 12 different sheets for a year means you lose sight of the big picture. How do you track finances over five years like that? My system runs multi-year on one sheet.

**Unrealistic Goals:** Strict envelope budgeting falls apart by mid-month, and you end up re-adjusting budgets more than living your life. Keep estimations simple—track income versus actual spending for the current month. Those are the only numbers that matter.

**Logging Each Transaction Manually:** If you have 10 transactions a day and log them all individually, what's the real value? Focus on how much you've spent in a category for the day. People give up because they make budgeting a chore instead of a tool.

The goal isn't perfect tracking—it's sustainable awareness that reduces money anxiety while building wealth.`
