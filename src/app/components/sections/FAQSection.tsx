    {
      question: "How much does Simplify Budget cost?",
      answer: "Normally $30, but we're offering it for $15 for a limited time. One-time payment, no monthly fees, no subscriptions. Use forever with free lifetime updates."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I try it for free?",
      answer: "Yes! Start with a 30-day free trial. All features included, no credit card required. Perfect for testing if Simplify Budget fits your workflow."
    },
    {
      question: "How is this different from YNAB or Mint?",
      answer: "Your data stays in your Google Drive (not our servers), one-time payment (not subscription), Monthly Expense Calendar for faster expense entry, and perfect for families since multiple people can use the same budget."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I set up the app?",
      answer: "Open the app, go to settings, and click 'New Database'. It automatically creates a new Google Sheet in your Drive and links it. That's it - you're ready to start tracking. Takes 30 seconds."
    },
    {
      question: "Can multiple people use the same budget?",
      answer: "Yes! Since your data lives in Google Sheets, anyone you share the sheet with can use the same budget in Simplify Budget. Perfect for couples, families, or business partners who want to track expenses together."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens to my data if I stop using Simplify Budget?",
      answer: "Your financial data stays in your Google Sheets forever. Since we don't store your data on our servers, you can stop using the app anytime and still access all your financial history in Google Sheets."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the Monthly Expense Calendar work?",
      answer: "Imagine a calendar where days are rows and your spending categories (food, gas, shopping) are columns. To track an expense, just tap where the day meets the category - like Monday + Food = $12 lunch. You see your whole month's spending at once."
    },
    {
      question: "Does Simplify Budget work on mobile devices?",
      answer: "Yes! Simplify Budget is fully mobile optimized. Most users add expenses on their phone throughout the day since it's so quick and visual. The app works perfectly on phones, tablets, and desktop."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the subscription tracker work?",
      answer: "Set up each recurring payment once with its amount, frequency (monthly/quarterly/yearly), and end date. Simplify Budget automatically generates future payments and shows them in your Monthly Expense Calendar and budget. No end date? It keeps creating payments for the next cycle."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize the expense categories?",
      answer: "You can rename, reorder, and hide/show any of the 30 categories. We don't allow deleting categories to preserve your historical data - if you had expenses in a category you no longer use, they'll still appear in your reports."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my financial data private and secure?",
      answer: "Your financial data never touches our servers - it only exists in your Google Drive. We literally cannot see your transactions, balances, or spending patterns. Since your data stays in your own Google account, you maintain full control and ownership."
    },
    {
      question: "What currencies does Simplify Budget support?",
      answer: "Simplify Budget supports all major currencies. You can set your preferred currency in the settings, and all calculations and displays will use your chosen currency format."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Simplify Budget verified by Google?",
      answer: "Yes! Simplify Budget has passed Google's OAuth verification process for Google Apps Script applications. This means Google has reviewed our app for security and privacy compliance, and users see a 'verified' badge instead of security warnings when granting permissions. The verification covers our privacy policy, data handling practices, and ensures we follow Google's security standards. Your data is protected by Google's security infrastructure and never leaves your Google account."
